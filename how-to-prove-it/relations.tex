\section{Ordered Pairs and Cartesian Products}
When making a truth set for a statement with more than one free variables, the truth set will not contain individual values, but rather ordered pairs of values. The order of values in an ordered pair makes a difference. That means $(6, 18)$ is not the same as $(18, 6)$. When referring to $a$, $b$, $c$, etc. in an ordered pair $(a, b, c, ...)$, we call them \glspl{coordinate}. $a$ is the first coordinate, $b$ is the second, etc.\\

\noindent Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. Then the Cartesian product of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs in which the first coordinate is an element of $A$ and the second is an element of $B$. In other words,
\begin{center}
$A \times B = \{(a,b) \mid a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}$.
\end{center}
